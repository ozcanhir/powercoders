row back (0)
row with the fox to the other side (1)
row with the goose to the other side (2)
row with the sack of corn to the other side (3)
Only instruction (2) can be executed without loosing or the goose, or the corn and then we are stuck ... or not?

It is not prohibited to row back with an item. So supplementary instructions are:

row back with the fox (4)
row back with the goose (5)
row back with the sack of corn (6)
So the sequence of instructions to solve this problem is:

(2) – (0) – (1) – (5) – (3) – (0) – (2)
